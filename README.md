This is a mini project I have made while learning web development.
It is ToDo list web application and you can visit it on the following URL:
https://quiet-bastion-64989.herokuapp.com/

Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, EJS (templating), mongoDB (database).
Hosted using heroku apps.

NOTE: You can create multiple ToDo lists with each having their own items by simply adding the name in the URL. [url/"something"]
Eg. { https://quiet-bastion-64989.herokuapp.com/work } will create a "work" ToDo list and have it's own unique items you add.
